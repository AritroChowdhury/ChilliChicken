1. To a bowl add 250 grams of cubed boneless chicken,1 1/2tsp soya sauce,1 1/2 tsp chilli sauce and 1/4 tsp pepper powder,sprinkle cornflour,plain flour if using and salt on the chicken.if you like to have a thick crunchy coating of the flour like in resturants add 1 tsp more of plain flour and corn flour.Egg white only as needed.You can also use water if you have brined the chicken.do not use a lot of liquid.Mix well to coat,if the chicken is too dry,sprinkle more water or more egg white and mix.Add red chilli powder and mix again.this helps to get a good colour.This is optional.If you add too much egg or water and make the batter,it will absorb a lot of oil and not turn crispy.
2. Heat oil until hot enough.Shallow fry or deep fry the chicken until golden.Drain off on the kitchen tissue.It can also be grilled in a preheated oven for 240 C for 20 to 25 minutes depending on the size of the pieces .You can also put them in a skewer and grill.
3. Prepare the sauce in a seasoning bowl.This way you will not end up using more sauces.Add 1tsp soya sauce,3/4 to 1 tsp vinegar,1/2 to 1 tsp sugar,1/2 tsp red chilli powder,2 tsp chilli sauce,2tsp ketchup in a bowl.Mix together all of these with 2 to 3 tsp water.Sauce must be thick yet of pouring consistency,chilli powder here again for the colour.
